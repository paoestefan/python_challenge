Code by python to analize csv files

PyBank talks about money and months
For this I use a loop and some functions to find the max and min value

Pypoll talks about votes and candidates,this was in a really big file.
For this I also use a loop and functions combine with conditionals, also I got to google how to print in a preatty format in the txt file
